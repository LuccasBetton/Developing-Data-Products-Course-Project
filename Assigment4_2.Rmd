## Introduction

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## Objective

The user will be able to set the minium and maximum weight and miles per gallon  (y and x axis minimum and maximum), filter the data by the types of cylinders and/or by the type of transmission, and finally create a linear regression grouping by the cylinders, transimission or none.
